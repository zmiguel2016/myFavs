# myFavs

This full-stack node application serves as a music library for my friends and I to share songs and artists we really enjoy with each other. The app allows you to add a song by inputting all the song details in a form or by using Spotify's API to search for a song and then add it directly to the database. This allows you to easily find songs that exist on Spotify and add them to the library or add more underground songs that only exist on other platforms.
